# Functional Programming

## Introduction

This open-source repository provides a resource for which computer science students and job seekers can study for functional programming interviews effectively.

The 80/20 Rule, or the Pareto principle, is the observation that 80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes or inputs. In terms of studying, this is useful for identifying high-yield concepts and algorithms that when understood allow for the students to work through 80% to 100% of the problems they encounter. This resource is built around this rule, seeking to provide students with the foundational knowledge needed to solve similar problems across this breadth of categories:

* 1 - Arrays and Hashing
* 2a - Two Pointers
* 2b - Stack
* 3c - Binary Search
* 3d - Sliding Windows
* 3e - Linked List
* 4 - Trees
* 5a - Tries
* 5b - Backtracking
* 6a - Heap/Priority Queue
* 6b - Graphs
* 6c - One-Dimensional Dynamic Programming
* 7a - Intervals
* 7b - Greedy
* 7c - Advanced Graphs
* 7d - Two-Dimensional Dynamic Programming
* 7e - Bit Manipulation
* 8 - Math & Geometry

## Usage

See the `guide/` directory for theoretical knowledge, such as concepts and algorithms.

See the `code/` directory for LeetCode problem solutions based in these concepts. These may not always be the fastest possible solution, but they are solutions that you should understand and would be expected to understand if asked.

## Getting Help

Issue tracker is your friend here. I will make note of anything there - be it a small addition you'd like to request, something I have done incorrectly, or a general recommendation.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this and add any contributions, such as more problems or solutions in different languages.
