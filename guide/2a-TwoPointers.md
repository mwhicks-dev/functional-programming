# 2a Two Pointers

Two pointers problem simply involve moving two pointers inwards or outwards on a list. These are an extension, and often an optimization, of [Arrays and Hashing](./1-ArraysHashing.md) problems or special cases of them.

## Key Concepts

Worry not - Two Pointers problems often do not involve actual C/C++ style pointers. (Although sometimes they can!) Really, these problems just specify two pieces of data representing some location in a list, say, two integer list indices, or two LinkedList nodes, in the context of a problem where this is valuable. There is not anything new here - just a different style of programming solution.

## Key Algorithms

None! Just look to use two pointers whenever you are trying to optimize or manipulate two parts of a list in some way, particularly when position in the list impacts the solution or target value in some way.
